### Background: 

Like many generalist species, the diverse foraging strategies of ringtails (*Bassariscus astutus*) allow them to inhabit a wide range of ecoregions across North America. As omnivores, ringtails are known to eat a range of plants, insects, small mammals, and other food items. In this study, we conduct a literature review of ringtail diet studies (n=40) to describe the various plants, prey, and inorganic items consumed by ringtails, describe ringtail dietary diversity across ecoregions, and highlight gaps in the current understanding of ringtail diet. Studies were found through a systematic literature review and supplemented by other scholarly publications. Within each study, we documented identified diet items, their taxonomic rank, methods, sample size, and location. We hypothesize that fresh scat analysis will show the highest taxonomic richness, as it experiences less environmental degradation than other physical examination methods. We also document unique diet items found in observational studies to describe their usefulness in dietary analysis studies. Finally, we conduct a comparison of diets to understand differences in ringtail diet composition. This study sheds light informs the dietary diversity of a flexible mesocarnivore and the factors that influence omniviry.
