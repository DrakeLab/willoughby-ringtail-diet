### Background: 

Like many generalist species, the diverse foraging strategies of ringtails (*Bassariscus astutus*) allow them to inhabit a wide range of ecoregions across North America. As omnivores, ringtails are known to eat a range of plants, insects, small mammals, and other food items. In this study, we conduct a literature review of previous ringtail diet studies (n=40) to compare diet analysis methodologies, describe ringtail dietary diversity across ecoregions, and highlight gaps in the current understanding of ringtail diet. Studies were found through a systematic literature review and supplemented by our own field-collected data from Zion National Park, Utah. Within each study, we documented identified diet items, their taxonomic rank, methods, sample size, and location. We then constructed rarefaction curves of identified diet items for all studies, as well as compared between ecoregions and methodologies. We hypothesize that fresh scat analysis will show the highest taxonomic richness, as it experiences less environmental degradation than other physical examination methods. We also document unique diet items found in observational studies to describe their usefulness in dietary analysis studies. Finally, we conduct a fine-grain comparison of three ecoregions to understand spatial differences in ringtail diet composition. This study sheds light on the various methods of mammalian dietary analysis and informs the dietary diversity of a flexible mesocarnivore.

### Research questions:
 1) Where and when have ringtail diet studies occured? 
 2) What is the diet diversity of ringtails? Does this change with ecoregion or study method? 
 3) How complete is our knowledge of ringtail diet? What methods or areas show the greatest promise for future study?
